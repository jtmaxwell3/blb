This package implements a Chrome extension for blueletterbible.org.
The Chrome extension adds a literal, word-for-word translation of Hebrew with inflection information.

The Python code uses the following:
https://github.com/ibc-oarc/Hebrew_lexicon.git

This needs to have ../interlinear_bible and ../strongs installed if you want to generate strongs-to-english.js using the Python code.
../interlinear_bible is from https://github.com/tahmmee/interlinear_bibledata/blob/master/interlinear/bible.tar.gz.
../strongs is from https://github.com/openscriptures/strongs.git.
get_conjugation.js and get_plural.js in chrome-extension is from https://github.com/BryanKoo/english-inflection.
